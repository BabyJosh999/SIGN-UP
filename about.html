    <h1>Premise and plot</h1>
    <h2>Game of Thrones follows a large cast of characters and interwoven story arcs.<br>
        It is primarily set on the fictional continent of Westeros, which is divided into<br>
        the Seven Kingdoms and the lands in the far North beyond “the Wall,” an <br>
        enormous wall of fortified ice. The Seven Kingdoms is a realm composed of<br>
        seven once independent kingdoms that have been, to greater or lesser degrees,<br>
        unified under a single monarch, who sits on the Iron Throne.The planet on<br>
        which Westeros is found has seasons of variable lengths, with summers and<br>
        winters often lasting for many years.</h2>

        <h2>The series focuses on several noble houses of Westeros and a complicated,<br>
            multiparty war for the Iron Throne that features shifting conflicts, alliances,<br>
            and betrayals.  Key houses include the Starks, who rule in the North; the Lannisters,<br>
            a wealthy family from the West who have married into the royal line; the Baratheons,<br>
            who at the outset hold the Iron Throne; and the Targaryens, who once controlled the Iron<br>
            Throne using dragons but who have been nearly wiped out by the time the story begins.
