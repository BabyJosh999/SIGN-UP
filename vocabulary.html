    <h1>A Cheat Sheet Of Game Of Thrones<br>
         Words & Terminology<br>
        You Need For Season</h1>
    <h2>Let’s be honest, the vocabulary of Game Of Thrones can be kind of confusing.
        While there’s clearly a lot of meaning behind everything everyone’s saying,<br>
        it would be nice if the show provided a guide to make things a bit easier, right?
        Especially since the HBO series hasn’t been on the air for nearly two years and<br>
        it’s possible you might have forgotten some of Game of Thrones words and key terms.
        But, don’t worry, we’re here for you. We’ve come up with a list of some of the more<br>
        important words and phrases from Game Of Thrones, some of which were created specifically
        for the show. The entire Dothraki language? Yeah, you can talk to linguist David J. Peterson about that.<br>
        This is more of study guide to help prepare you for the eighth and final season of Game Of Thrones.</h2>
